    <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>EduRahisi is dedicated to providing accessible and 
            high-quality educational resources for students,
             teachers, and parents.
            Over the past years, we have seen students, parents and 
            teachers struggle to connect. Students often do not have
             a platform to learn from, teachers do not have a platform 
             to showcase what they have got and parents are unable to 
             easily monitor their childrenâ€™s progress. As EduRahisi 
             therefore, we have seen it better to provide a 3 in 1 
             platform where all these things can happen. EduRahisi 
             is more than just a platform - it is a community dedicated 
             to making education more inclusive, engaging and effective, 
             shaping the mentality of learners and the future of learning.
            </p>
    <p>Our mission is to bridge the gap between learners
         and educators, fostering a collaborative environment
        that promotes growth and success.
        We believe in the power of education to transform lives and 
        communities, and we are committed to making 
        learning accessible to everyone.</p>
